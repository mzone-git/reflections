it was faster
more accurate
manual commits more flexible
git clone - make a copy of a repository (copies all versions to local directory)
git log - show commit #, author, comments
git diff - show changes between two commits
git checkout - use a particular version of the code

easy to revert changes if you introduce bugs into code
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

create a new repository:
    git init
NOTE: will not create a commit

display files changed since last commit:
    git status
